# Find an auction

Find items if you want to buy them from eBay

# Requirements

This program has been tested with Scala 2.11.6.

You need to create a free eBay API account:

     https://go.developer.ebay.com/what-ebay-api

Create your Application ID in eBay there.

You need to download the eBay Java SDK archive at:

     https://go.developer.ebay.com/ebay-sdks

Unzip the archive and add the `src/lib/finding.jar`
and the `src/lib/log4j-1.2.16.jar` JAR files to
your CLASSPATH.

The initial idea of this program is a Java sample
authored by boyang inside eBay Java SDK archive.
